Welcome to this FMOD Tutorial Project.

This project will teach you many of the basic, as well as a few more advanced, tools and techniques of implementing FMOD Studio sounds into a Unity project.
 
Everything you need to know about setting up your project with the FMOD Unity Integration can be found at 
http://www.fmod.org/documentation/#content/generated/engine_new_unity/getting_started.html.
There is a lot of documentation to hopfully help any issue that may arrise, otherwise the Q&A forums 
(http://www.fmod.org/questions/categories/unity) are a great place to find answers.


Key points to keep in mind:

***Using headphones will enhance the experience and give you a better understanding of what is happening***

- Press ESC for the Main Menu, and ESC again to close it.

- Options (Graphics Settings/Volume Controls) are available in the Main Menu.

- Teleporting to each room is accessed through the ESC Menu.

- Floating FMOD logo's around the world will give you more information when activated by looking directly at them.

- All the sounds in the project are using FMOD Studio and the FMOD Unity Integration.

- We have tried to use the default FMOD scripts that come with the Integration as much as possible just to show how easy it is to use.

- In every custom script containing FMOD, you will see this comment structure before the lines that refer to FMOD:

                /*===============================================Fmod====================================================
                |                     So using - find "FMOD" should take you to all the important bits.                 |
                =======================================================================================================*/

- Feel free to use any and everything from this project in your own games!
